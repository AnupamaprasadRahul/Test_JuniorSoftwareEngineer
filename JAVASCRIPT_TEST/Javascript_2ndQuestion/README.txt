QUESTION:
Implement a JavaScript class called “Calculator” that has four methods: add, subtract,multiply and divide.
These methods should perform the respective mathematical operations on two numbers and return the result.
                     *-------------------------------------------------------*

-> created a class named Calculator.
-> inside the Calculator class, there are four methods - add, subtract, multiply and divide, to perform the respective mathematical operations.
-> passed two number parameters as arguments- num1 and num2.
-> returns the sum of num1 and num2 in add method.
-> returns the difference of num1 and num2 in subtract method.
-> returns the product of num1 and num2 in multiply method.
-> returns the division of num1 and num2 in divide method. In divide(num1, num2) method, if num2 is equal to zero returns an error.

->For performing the program, need to call the Calculator class by declaring using new keyword.

             '"const calculate=new Calculator()"'
-> return the addition value to a variable - add - by providing the two numbers to Calculator Class object(calculate).add method.
-> return the subtraction value to a variable - subtract - by providing the two numbers to Calculator Class object(calculate).subtract method.
-> return the multiplication value to a variable - multiply - by providing the two numbers to Calculator Class object(calculate).multiply method.
-> return the division value to a variable - divide - by providing the two numbers to Calculator Class object(calculate).divide method.
